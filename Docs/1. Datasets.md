# Datasets

This details the datasets used for this project and how to obtain all of them.

## GDC Dataset

From the GDC Data Portal, we take 3 datasets:

- <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-BLCA>
- <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-BRCA>
- <https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-KIRC>

In order to download them, we'll be utilizing the GDC Client and the manifest files obtained from the links above.
When you download a manifest file, it'll take a name akin to `gdc_manifest.2022-11-18.txt`.

``` shell
!wget https://gdc.cancer.gov/files/public/file/gdc-client_v1.6.1_Ubuntu_x64.zip
unzip gdc-client_v1.6.1_Ubuntu_x64.zip

./gdc-client download -m <manifest>
```

In this repo, all the datasets are stored within the folder `./Datasets`
